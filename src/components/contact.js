          <p>
            Welcome to my personal space on the web! I'm Nitya Hoyos, a
            dedicated and passionate full-stack web developer based in the
            vibrant city of Los Angeles. With a robust 8 years of experience in
            the tech industry, I specialize in creating seamless and dynamic
            digital experiences from the ground up.
          </p>
          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Born and raised in Los Angeles, I have always been fascinated by the
            endless possibilities that coding and technology present. My career
            began straight out of college, where I dived deep into both
            front-end and back-end technologies. Over the years, I've had the
            privilege of working on a wide range of projects, from innovative
            startup websites to complex enterprise solutions.
          </p>
          <h2>What I Do</h2>
          <p>
            As a solo developer, I handle every aspect of the development
            process, ensuring that every line of code not only meets but exceeds
            the expectations of my clients and their users. My expertise spans a
            variety of programming languages and frameworks, including but not
            limited to JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, and Django. I am
            deeply committed to leveraging the latest technologies to deliver
            responsive, user-friendly, and efficient applications.
          </p>
          <h2>Beyond Coding</h2>
          <p>

            When I'm not glued to my computer screen, you'll likely find me
            exploring the lush trails around Los Angeles on my bike. Cycling is
            not just a hobbyâ€”it's a way for me to recharge, find inspiration,
            and connect with nature.
          </p>
